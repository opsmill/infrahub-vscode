# Infrahub VSCode Extension

A Visual Studio Code extension that enhances the development experience for [Infrahub](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub) - the open-source infrastructure automation platform. This extension provides intelligent tooling for working with Infrahub schemas, GraphQL queries, and configuration files.

## Overview

The Infrahub VSCode Extension streamlines infrastructure-as-code development by providing real-time connectivity to Infrahub servers, schema validation, GraphQL query execution, and branch management capabilities directly within your IDE. Whether you're defining infrastructure models, writing automation queries, or managing schema versions across branches, this extension accelerates your workflow and reduces context switching.

## Use Cases

- **Schema Development**: Create and validate Infrahub schemas with real-time feedback and auto-completion
- **GraphQL Query Testing**: Write and execute GraphQL queries against live Infrahub instances without leaving VSCode
- **Branch-based Workflows**: Manage infrastructure changes across different branches with Git-like version control
- **Multi-Server Development**: Connect to multiple Infrahub environments (dev, staging, production) simultaneously
- **Infrastructure Modeling**: Develop network device models, data center schemas, and service definitions with YAML validation
- **Automation Development**: Build and test automation workflows that integrate with Infrahub's graph database

```

## Usage Examples

### Configure Infrahub Servers

1. Open VSCode Settings (`Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`)
2. Search for "Infrahub"
3. Add server configurations:

```json
{
  "infrahub-vscode.servers": [
    {
      "name": "Development",
      "address": "http://localhost:8000",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN}"
    },
    {
      "name": "Production",
      "address": "https://infrahub.example.com",
      "api_token": "your-api-token-here"
    }
  ],
  "infrahub-vscode.schemaDirectory": "schemas"
}
```

### Working with Schemas

Create a new schema file in your `schemas/` directory:

```yaml
# schemas/network.yml
version: '1.0'
nodes:
  - name: Device
    namespace: Network
    attributes:
      - name: hostname
        kind: Text
        unique: true
      - name: model
        kind: Text
    relationships:
      - name: interfaces
        peer: NetworkInterface
        kind: Component
```

The extension will automatically validate the schema and provide IntelliSense support.

### Executing GraphQL Queries

1. Create a query file in your project:

```graphql
# queries/get_devices.gql
query GetDevices($limit: Int = 10) {
  NetworkDevice(limit: $limit) {
    edges {
      node {
        hostname
        model
        interfaces {
          edges {
            node {
              name
              status
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Right-click the query in the Infrahub YAML tree view
3. Select "Execute GraphQL Query"
4. Choose server and branch
5. Fill in any required variables
6. View results in the output panel

### Managing Branches

#### Create a New Branch

1. Open the Infrahub Servers view
2. Right-click on a server
3. Select "New Branch"
4. Enter branch name and description

#### Delete a Branch

1. Expand a server in the tree view to see branches
2. Right-click on a branch
3. Select "Delete Branch"
4. Confirm deletion

### Using .infrahub.yml Files

The extension automatically detects and parses `.infrahub.yml` files in your workspace:

```yaml
# .infrahub.yml
---
schemas:
  - schemas/network.yml
  - schemas/location.yml

queries:
  - name: get_all_devices
    file: queries/devices.gql
  - name: topology_report
    file: queries/topology.gql

checks:
  - name: validate_hostnames
    file: checks/hostname_validator.py
```

Navigate through the structure using the Infrahub YAML tree view.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

While the extension doesn't define default keyboard shortcuts, you can add your own:

1. Open Keyboard Shortcuts (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+K Cmd+S`)
2. Search for "Infrahub"
3. Add keybindings for frequently used commands:
   - `infrahub.executeGraphQLQuery`
   - `infrahub.newBranch`
   - `infrahub.editInfrahubYaml`

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code v1.102.0 or higher
- Active Infrahub server instance (v0.15.0 or higher recommended)
- Valid API token for authentication (optional but recommended)

## Extension Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `infrahub-vscode.servers` | Array of Infrahub server configurations | `[]` |
| `infrahub-vscode.schemaDirectory` | Directory containing schema files | `"schemas"` |

## Troubleshooting

### Server Connection Issues

- Verify the server address is correct and accessible
- Check API token validity
- Ensure network connectivity to the Infrahub server
- Look for error messages in the status bar

### Schema Validation Not Working

- Confirm files are in the configured schema directory
- Check file extensions (`.yml` or `.yaml`)
- Verify YAML syntax is valid

### GraphQL Queries Not Executing

- Ensure you have selected a valid server and branch
- Check that required variables are provided
- Verify query syntax is valid
