# Infrahub VSCode Extension

A Visual Studio Code extension that enhances the development experience for [Infrahub](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub) - the open-source infrastructure automation platform. This extension provides intelligent tooling for working with Infrahub schemas, GraphQL queries, and configuration files.

## Overview

The Infrahub VSCode Extension streamlines infrastructure-as-code development by providing real-time connectivity to Infrahub servers, schema validation, GraphQL query execution, and branch management capabilities directly within your IDE. Whether you're defining infrastructure models, writing automation queries, or managing schema versions across branches, this extension accelerates your workflow and reduces context switching.

## Use Cases

- **Schema Development**: Create and validate Infrahub schemas with real-time feedback and auto-completion
- **GraphQL Query Testing**: Write and execute GraphQL queries against live Infrahub instances without leaving VSCode
- **Branch-based Workflows**: Manage infrastructure changes across different branches with Git-like version control
- **Multi-Server Development**: Connect to multiple Infrahub environments (dev, staging, production) simultaneously
- **Infrastructure Modeling**: Develop network device models, data center schemas, and service definitions with YAML validation
- **Automation Development**: Build and test automation workflows that integrate with Infrahub's graph database
