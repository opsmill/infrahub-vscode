Added transform execution support for Infrahub YAML configuration files. The extension now detects and displays transform types (Jinja2 or Python) in the YAML tree view, automatically determines the appropriate `infrahubctl` command (`render` for Jinja2 transforms, `transform` for Python transforms), and provides context-sensitive run commands for artifact definitions. Enhanced tree view provider with improved code structure and better type detection logic.
