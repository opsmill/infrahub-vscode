# How to Configure Multiple Infrahub Servers

If you need to work with multiple Infrahub environments (development, staging, production), this guide shows you how to configure and manage multiple server connections in the VSCode extension.

## Prerequisites

- Infrahub VSCode extension installed
- Access to multiple Infrahub servers
- API tokens for each server (if authentication is required)

## Step 1: Open Extension Settings

Open your VSCode settings configuration:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
2. Type "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)"
3. Press Enter

## Step 2: Add Multiple Server Configurations

Add your server configurations to the settings file:

```json
{
  "infrahub-vscode.servers": [
    {
      "name": "Development",
      "address": "http://localhost:8000",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN}"
    },
    {
      "name": "Staging",
      "address": "https://staging.infrahub.example.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_STAGING_TOKEN}"
    },
    {
      "name": "Production",
      "address": "https://infrahub.example.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_PROD_TOKEN}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

For security, use environment variables for API tokens:

### On macOS/Linux:

Add to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN="your-dev-token"
export INFRAHUB_STAGING_TOKEN="your-staging-token"
export INFRAHUB_PROD_TOKEN="your-prod-token"
```

Then reload your shell or restart VSCode.

### On Windows:

Using PowerShell:

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN', 'your-dev-token', 'User')
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('INFRAHUB_STAGING_TOKEN', 'your-staging-token', 'User')
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('INFRAHUB_PROD_TOKEN', 'your-prod-token', 'User')
```

Restart VSCode after setting environment variables.

## Step 4: Verify All Connections

1. Open the Infrahub Servers tree view in the Activity Bar
2. You should see all three servers listed
3. Expand each server to verify it can retrieve branches
4. Check the status bar - it shows the first server's connection status

## Step 5: Switch Between Servers for Queries

When executing GraphQL queries:

1. Right-click on a query in the Infrahub YAML tree view
2. Select "Execute GraphQL Query"
3. You'll be prompted to select a server from your configured list
4. Choose the appropriate environment
5. Select the branch to query against

## Advanced Configuration

### Using Different Schemas per Environment

Configure different schema directories for each environment:

```json
{
  "infrahub-vscode.servers": [
    {
      "name": "Development",
      "address": "http://localhost:8000",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN}"
    },
    {
      "name": "Production",
      "address": "https://infrahub.example.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_PROD_TOKEN}"
    }
  ],
  "infrahub-vscode.schemaDirectory": "${env:ENVIRONMENT}/schemas"
}
```

### Server Groups with Naming Conventions

Use clear naming conventions to organize servers:

```json
{
  "infrahub-vscode.servers": [
    {
      "name": "[LOCAL] Development",
      "address": "http://localhost:8000"
    },
    {
      "name": "[AWS] US-East-1 Staging",
      "address": "https://staging-us-east-1.infrahub.example.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_AWS_STAGING_TOKEN}"
    },
    {
      "name": "[AWS] US-East-1 Production",
      "address": "https://us-east-1.infrahub.example.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_AWS_PROD_TOKEN}"
    },
    {
      "name": "[Azure] Europe-West Production",
      "address": "https://eu-west.infrahub.example.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_AZURE_PROD_TOKEN}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Validation

To verify your configuration is working correctly:

1. **Check Status Bar**: The first server's status appears in the status bar
2. **Tree View**: All servers should appear in the Infrahub Servers tree view
3. **Branch Listing**: Expanding each server should show its branches
4. **Query Execution**: Test a simple query against each server

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Appearing in Tree View

- Save your settings.json file
- Reload VSCode window (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R`)
- Check for JSON syntax errors in settings

### Authentication Failures

- Verify environment variables are set correctly:
  ```bash
  echo $INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN  # macOS/Linux
  echo %INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN%  # Windows CMD
  ```
- Ensure tokens have necessary permissions
- Check token expiration dates

### Connection Timeouts

- Verify server URLs are accessible from your network
- Check for proxy/firewall restrictions
- Ensure VPN connection if required
