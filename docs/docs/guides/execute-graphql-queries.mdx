title: How to Execute GraphQL Queries
description: Run GraphQL queries against Infrahub servers with variable support and branch selection
---

If you want to test GraphQL queries against your Infrahub instance without leaving VSCode, this guide shows you how to write, organize, and execute queries using the extension.

## Prerequisites

- Infrahub VSCode extension installed and configured
- At least one Infrahub server configured
- A workspace with `.infrahub.yml` file

## Step 1: Create query files

Create a directory for your GraphQL queries:

```bash
mkdir queries
```

Create a GraphQL query file `queries/get_devices.gql`:

```graphql
query GetDevices($status: String = "active") {
  NetworkDevice(status__value: $status) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        hostname {
          value
        }
        model {
          value
        }
        status {
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Register queries in .infrahub.yml

Create or update your `.infrahub.yml` file to reference your queries:

```yaml
---
queries:
  - name: get_active_devices
    file: queries/get_devices.gql
    
  - name: get_interfaces
    file: queries/get_interfaces.gql
    
  - name: topology_report
    file: queries/topology.gql
```

## Step 3: Execute a query

1. Open the Infrahub YAML tree view in the Activity Bar
2. Expand your `.infrahub.yml` file
3. Navigate to the queries section
4. Right-click on "get_active_devices"
5. Select **Execute GraphQL Query**
6. Choose your server when prompted
7. Select the branch (usually "main")
8. View results in the new panel that opens

## Step 4: Work with query variables

For queries with variables, create `queries/get_devices_by_location.gql`:

```graphql
query GetDevicesByLocation(
  $location: String!,
  $limit: Int = 10,
  $offset: Int = 0
) {
  NetworkDevice(
    location__name__value: $location,
    limit: $limit,
    offset: $offset
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        hostname {
          value
        }
        location {
          node {
            name {
              value
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When executing this query:

1. You'll be prompted for required variables (`$location`)
2. Optional variables (`$limit`, `$offset`) can be left empty to use defaults
3. Enter values in the input prompts that appear

## Step 5: Query different branches

To execute queries against specific branches:

1. Right-click on your query in the tree view
2. Select **Execute GraphQL Query**
3. Choose your server
4. You'll see a list of available branches
5. Select the branch you want to query
6. The query executes against that branch's data

## Step 6: Complex query examples

### Query with nested relationships

```graphql
query GetDeviceDetails($device_id: String!) {
  NetworkDevice(id: $device_id) {
    edges {
      node {
        hostname {
          value
        }
        interfaces {
          edges {
            node {
              name {
                value
              }
              ip_addresses {
                edges {
                  node {
                    address {
                      value
                    }
                    prefix {
                      node {
                        prefix {
                          value
                        }
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Mutation example

```graphql
mutation CreateDevice(
  $hostname: String!,
  $model: String!,
  $location_id: String!
) {
  NetworkDeviceCreate(
    data: {
      hostname: { value: $hostname }
      model: { value: $model }
      location: { id: $location_id }
    }
  ) {
    ok
    object {
      id
      hostname {
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 7: Organize queries by category

Structure your `.infrahub.yml` for better organization:

```yaml
---
queries:
  # Inventory Queries
  - name: inventory_all_devices
    file: queries/inventory/all_devices.gql
    
  - name: inventory_by_location
    file: queries/inventory/by_location.gql
    
  # Network Topology
  - name: topology_layer2
    file: queries/topology/layer2.gql
    
  - name: topology_layer3
    file: queries/topology/layer3.gql
    
  # Reporting
  - name: report_capacity
    file: queries/reports/capacity.gql
    
  - name: report_compliance
    file: queries/reports/compliance.gql
```

## Validation

To verify your queries are working:

1. **Syntax Check**: The extension validates GraphQL syntax
2. **Test Execution**: Run each query with sample variables
3. **Branch Testing**: Execute against different branches
4. **Result Verification**: Check the output panel for expected data

## Advanced usage

### Using fragments

Create reusable fragments in `queries/fragments.gql`:

```graphql
fragment DeviceBasicInfo on NetworkDevice {
  id
  hostname {
    value
  }
  model {
    value
  }
  status {
    value
  }
}

query GetDevicesWithFragment {
  NetworkDevice {
    edges {
      node {
        ...DeviceBasicInfo
        location {
          node {
            name {
              value
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Batch operations

For multiple related queries, create a batch file:

```graphql
query BatchDeviceQuery(
  $location: String!,
  $status: String = "active"
) {
  devices: NetworkDevice(
    location__name__value: $location,
    status__value: $status
  ) {
    count
    edges {
      node {
        hostname {
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  interfaces: NetworkInterface(
    device__location__name__value: $location
  ) {
    count
  }
  
  locations: LocationSite(
    name__value: $location
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        name {
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Query execution fails

- Verify the GraphQL syntax is correct
- Check that all required variables are provided
- Ensure the schema types exist in your Infrahub instance
- Verify you have permission to access the queried data

### Variables not prompting

- Check variable definitions in your query
- Required variables use `!` (for example, `$location: String!`)
- Optional variables have defaults (for example, `$limit: Int = 10`)

### No results returned

- Verify data exists on the selected branch
- Check filters in your query
- Ensure proper permissions for the data
