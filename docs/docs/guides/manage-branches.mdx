title: How to Manage Branches
description: Create, delete, and work with Infrahub branches directly from VSCode
---

If you need to work with Infrahub's branch-based version control system, this guide shows you how to create, delete, and manage branches using the VSCode extension.

## Prerequisites

- Infrahub VSCode extension installed
- At least one configured Infrahub server
- Appropriate permissions to create/delete branches on your server

## Step 1: View existing branches

To see all branches on a server:

1. Open the Infrahub icon in the Activity Bar
2. Expand the "Infrahub Servers" tree view
3. Click on your server to expand it
4. You'll see all branches listed with:
   - Branch name
   - "(default)" marker for the main branch
   - Branch metadata when available

## Step 2: Create a new branch

### From the tree view

1. Right-click on your server in the Infrahub Servers view
2. Select **New Branch** from the context menu
3. Enter the branch name (for example, "feature-network-update")
4. Optionally add a description
5. Press Enter to create the branch

### Naming conventions

Follow these branch naming patterns for clarity:

- `feature-[description]` - New features
- `fix-[issue-number]` - Bug fixes
- `update-[component]` - Updates to existing components
- `test-[scenario]` - Testing branches
- `dev-[username]` - Personal development branches

Example: `feature-datacenter-schema`

## Step 3: Delete a branch

To remove a branch you no longer need:

1. Expand your server in the tree view
2. Right-click on the branch to delete
3. Select **Delete Branch**
4. Confirm the deletion when prompted

> **Warning**: Branch deletion is permanent. Ensure you've merged or saved any important changes before deleting.

## Step 4: Work with branch-specific data

### Execute queries on specific branches

When running GraphQL queries:

1. Right-click on a query in the Infrahub YAML view
2. Select **Execute GraphQL Query**
3. Choose your server
4. Select the target branch from the list
5. The query runs against that branch's data

### Compare data across branches

To compare data between branches, execute the same query on different branches:

```graphql
query BranchComparison {
  NetworkDevice {
    count
    edges {
      node {
        hostname {
          value
        }
        _updated_at
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Run this query on:

1. Main branch - baseline data
2. Feature branch - modified data
3. Compare the results to see differences

## Step 5: Branch workflow examples

### Feature development workflow

1. **Create Feature Branch**

   ```text
   Name: feature-add-firewall-schema
   Description: Adding firewall device schema and relationships
   ```

2. **Develop and Test**
   - Modify schemas
   - Test queries against the branch
   - Validate changes

3. **Merge Process**
   - Review changes
   - Merge via Infrahub UI or API
   - Delete feature branch after merge

### Hotfix workflow

1. **Create Hotfix Branch**

   ```text
   Name: fix-device-status-issue
   Description: Urgent fix for device status validation
   ```

2. **Apply Fix**
   - Make necessary corrections
   - Test on hotfix branch

3. **Deploy**
   - Merge to main
   - Verify fix
   - Clean up branch

## Step 6: Advanced branch management

### Working with long-lived branches

For branches that persist over time:

```yaml
# Document branch purposes in your project
# branches.yml
branches:
  - name: develop
    purpose: Integration branch for ongoing development
    merge_target: main
    
  - name: staging
    purpose: Pre-production testing
    merge_target: main
    
  - name: feature-q4-updates
    purpose: Q4 feature development
    merge_target: develop
```

### Branch metadata tracking

Track branch information in your queries:

```graphql
query BranchInfo {
  Branch {
    edges {
      node {
        name
        description
        created_at
        branched_from
        is_default
        has_schema_changes
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Validation

To ensure branch operations are working:

1. **Creation Verification**: New branch appears in tree view immediately
2. **Query Testing**: Execute a query against the new branch
3. **Deletion Confirmation**: Deleted branch disappears from tree view
4. **Refresh Check**: Tree view updates every 10 seconds automatically

## Best practices

### Branch lifecycle

1. **Create** with descriptive names
2. **Develop** in isolation
3. **Test** thoroughly on the branch
4. **Review** changes before merging
5. **Merge** when ready
6. **Delete** after successful merge

### Naming strategy

Use consistent prefixes:

- `feature-` for new functionality
- `fix-` for bug fixes
- `update-` for updates
- `test-` for experiments
- `release-` for release preparation

### Documentation

Document active branches:

```markdown
## Active Branches

### feature-network-redesign
- **Created**: 2024-01-15
- **Owner**: Network Team
- **Purpose**: Redesigning network schema for multi-vendor support
- **Target Merge**: 2024-02-01

### fix-validation-error
- **Created**: 2024-01-20
- **Owner**: DevOps
- **Purpose**: Fix schema validation for IP addresses
- **Target Merge**: ASAP
```

## Troubleshooting

### Branch creation fails

- Check server permissions
- Verify branch name doesn't already exist
- Ensure valid characters in branch name (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores)

### Branch not appearing

- Wait 10 seconds for automatic refresh
- Manually reload VSCode window if needed
- Check server connectivity

### Cannot delete branch

- Verify you have deletion permissions
- Ensure branch isn't protected
- Check if branch is the default branch (cannot be deleted)
