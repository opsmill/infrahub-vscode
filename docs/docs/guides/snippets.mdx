# How to use Infrahub snippets in VSCode

This guide shows you how to quickly insert and customize Infrahub YAML objects and automation scripts using built-in snippets in Visual Studio Code. By following these steps, you’ll save time and reduce errors when authoring Infrahub resources.

## Prerequisites

- Infrahub VSCode extension installed
- Workspace containing YAML or Python files
- Basic familiarity with editing files in VSCode

## Steps

### 1. Insert an Infrahub object snippet

1. Open any `.yaml` or `.yml` file in your project.
2. Type `infrahubobject` and select the snippet from the suggestion list.
3. The following template will be inserted:

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: infrahub.app/v1
    kind: Object
    spec:
      kind: ${1:kind}
      data:
        - name: "${2:name}"
    ```

4. Replace the placeholder values (`kind`, `name`) with your desired values.

### 2. Insert a Infrahub Python Snippet

1. Open a `.py` file in your workspace.
2. Type one of the following snippet prefixes and select it from the suggestion list:
    - `infrahubtransform` for a transform
    - `infrahubscript` for a script
    - `infrahubgenerator` for a generator
    - `infrahubcheck` for a check
3. Fill in the placeholders as needed to scaffold your automation script.
