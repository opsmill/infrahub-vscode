## Prerequisites

3. The following template will be inserted:

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: infrahub.app/v1
    kind: Object
    spec:
      kind: ${1:kind}
      data:
        - name: "${2:name}"
    ```

4. Replace the placeholder values (`kind`, `name`) with your desired values.

### 2. Insert a Infrahub Python Snippet

1. Open a `.py` file in your workspace.
2. Type one of the following snippet prefixes and select it from the suggestion list:
    - `infrahubtransform` for a transform
