Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Infrahub VSCode Extension. This extension transforms Visual Studio Code into a powerful development environment for working with [Infrahub](https://docs.infrahub.app), the open-source infrastructure automation platform.

## What is the Infrahub VSCode extension?

The Infrahub VSCode Extension provides intelligent tooling that connects directly to your Infrahub servers, enabling you to develop infrastructure schemas, execute GraphQL queries, and manage branch-based workflows without leaving your IDE. It brings the power of Infrahub's graph database and version control directly into your development workflow.
