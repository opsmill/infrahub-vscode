title: Understanding the Extension Architecture
description: Deep dive into how the Infrahub VSCode extension is designed and how its components work together
---

This document explains the architecture of the Infrahub VSCode extension, its design decisions, and how the various components interact to provide a seamless development experience for infrastructure automation.

## Overview

The Infrahub VSCode extension follows a modular architecture pattern that separates concerns into distinct components. This design enables maintainability, testability, and extensibility while providing real-time connectivity to Infrahub servers.

## Core architecture components

### Extension activation

The extension activates when VSCode detects specific conditions in your workspace:

```typescript
"activationEvents": [
  "workspaceContains:.infrahub.yml",
  "workspaceContains:.infrahub.yaml"
]
```

This lazy loading approach ensures the extension only consumes resources when you're working with Infrahub projects. The activation triggers when VSCode finds an `.infrahub.yml` or `.infrahub.yaml` file in your workspace, signaling that this is an Infrahub-enabled project.

### Component hierarchy

The extension architecture consists of several interconnected layers:

├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│          Extension Entry Point       │

├─────────────────────────────────────┤

├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│       Infrahub Server (Remote)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Key architectural patterns

### Provider pattern

The extension uses VSCode's provider pattern extensively. Providers are classes that implement specific interfaces to extend VSCode's functionality:

#### Tree data providers

Tree data providers manage the hierarchical views in the sidebar:

- **InfrahubServerTreeViewProvider**: Manages server connections and branch listings
- **InfrahubYamlTreeViewProvider**: Parses and displays `.infrahub.yml` structure

These providers implement the `TreeDataProvider` interface, which requires:

- `getTreeItem()`: Returns the UI representation of an item
- `getChildren()`: Returns child elements for expandable items
- `onDidChangeTreeData`: Event emitter for refreshing the tree

#### Language providers

Language providers enhance the editing experience:

- **YamlDefinitionProvider**: Enables go-to-definition for schema references
- **YamlDocumentSymbolProvider**: Creates document outline/symbols

### Event-driven updates

The extension uses an event-driven architecture for real-time updates:

```typescript
// Automatic refresh every 10 seconds
setInterval(() => InfrahubServerTreeView.refresh(), 10000);

// Configuration change listener
vscode.workspace.onDidChangeConfiguration(e => {
  if (e.affectsConfiguration('infrahub-vscode.servers')) {
    this.refresh();
  }
});
```

This approach ensures:

- Status bar updates reflect current server state
- Tree views stay synchronized with server changes
- Configuration changes take effect immediately

### Client management

The extension maintains a client pool for server connections:

```typescript
private clients: Map<string, InfrahubClient> = new Map();
```

Each server configuration creates a dedicated client instance, allowing:

- Concurrent connections to multiple servers
- Isolated authentication per server
- Efficient connection reuse

## Design decisions and rationale

### Why tree views?

Tree views were chosen as the primary UI component because:

1. **Familiar Paradigm**: Developers are accustomed to file explorers and tree structures
2. **Information Hierarchy**: Natural representation of servers → branches → schemas
3. **Contextual Actions**: Right-click menus provide discoverable functionality
4. **Space Efficiency**: Collapsible nodes manage complex information efficiently

### Status bar integration

The status bar provides ambient awareness of connection state:

- **Always Visible**: Users see server status without opening panels
- **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't interrupt workflow
- **Quick Feedback**: Color coding indicates connection health instantly

### Configuration strategy

The extension uses VSCode's built-in settings system rather than custom configuration files:

**Advantages**:

- Integrated with VSCode's settings UI
- Supports workspace and user-level settings
- Environment variable substitution for security
- Settings sync across devices

**Trade-offs**:

- Limited to JSON structure
- No runtime configuration changes
- Requires VSCode restart for some changes

### SDK integration

The extension uses the official `infrahub-sdk` package:

```typescript
import { InfrahubClient, InfrahubClientOptions } from 'infrahub-sdk';
```

**Benefits**:

- Consistent API with other Infrahub tools
- Maintained by the Infrahub team
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Automatic API version compatibility

## Mental models

### Connection lifecycle

Understanding how connections are established and maintained:

1. **Initialization**: Server configurations are loaded from settings
2. **Client Creation**: Each server gets an InfrahubClient instance
3. **Health Checking**: Status bar polls server health every 10 seconds
4. **Query Execution**: Clients are reused for GraphQL operations
5. **Cleanup**: Connections persist until VSCode closes

### Data flow

How data moves through the extension:

```text
User Action → Command Handler → Client Method → Server API
                    ↓                               ↓
              UI Update ← Result Processing ← API Response
```

Example: Executing a GraphQL query:

1. User right-clicks query in tree view
2. Command handler prompts for variables
3. Client sends query to selected server/branch
4. Results are formatted and displayed in webview
5. Tree view updates if data changed

### State management

The extension maintains minimal state:

- **Server Configurations**: Read from settings, cached in memory
- **Client Instances**: Stored in Map, reused across operations
- **Tree View State**: Managed by VSCode, persists across sessions
- **No Persistent Storage**: Extension doesn't write to disk

## Integration points

### VSCode extension API

The extension integrates with multiple VSCode APIs:

- **Commands API**: Registers executable commands
- **Tree View API**: Creates custom sidebar views
- **Language API**: Provides IntelliSense features
- **Webview API**: Displays query results
- **Status Bar API**: Shows server connection status

### Infrahub server

Communication with Infrahub servers occurs through:

- **GraphQL Endpoint**: Query and mutation execution
- **REST API**: Server version and health checks

### File system integration

The extension interacts with the workspace:

- **Schema Files**: Validates YAML in configured directories
- **Query Files**: Reads `.gql` files for execution
- **Configuration**: Parses `.infrahub.yml` for project structure

## Performance considerations

### Lazy loading

Components load only when needed:

- Tree views populate on expansion
- Clients connect on first use
- Validation runs on file save

### Caching strategy

The extension implements strategic caching:

- Server configurations cached until settings change
- Branch lists refresh every 10 seconds
- Client connections persist across operations

### Resource management

Efficient resource usage through:

- Single client instance per server
- Debounced validation on typing
- Incremental tree view updates

## Extension boundaries

### What the extension does

- **Client-Side Operations**: All processing happens locally
- **Read Operations**: Primarily queries data
- **UI Enhancement**: Improves developer experience
- **Validation**: Schema and syntax checking

### What the extension doesn't do

- **Server Management**: Cannot start/stop Infrahub servers
- **Data Persistence**: Doesn't store data locally
- **Background Sync**: No automatic data synchronization
- **Conflict Resolution**: Merge conflicts handled server-side
